**Simply Messenger**

Simple web-based messenger using Python's framework Flask

Usage

The application provides a basic interface for users to send messages.


most difficult was to make chat with concrete user. did it with hidden input

easy and rewarding was list of contacts. mainly cause i now have idea how flask, html and js work together

First main file was named app as in every tutorial on flask, but it was easier to config nginx and gunicorn with another name
